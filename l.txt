//http requset status

if the url status is 400,403,404 : it is a problem with the http request
if it is 500 series : it is a internal server error
if it is 200 series : it is successfull.


//password salting(happens when a user is registering for the first time)

if a user is entering a common passsword like hello,the hash can be attacked using a rainbow table(hash tables) for coomon passwords but if we add a string like "db" and add to this password,
the password hash will be changed to a whole new one.

//summary

the user entered password ("hello") is saved and the randomly generated string("abc") is attached to it.
(the user dosent know the randomly generated string)


then the ("helloabc") is converted to a hash("1234#") and saved in the database.


the user enters the password("hello"),then the programs search for the salt("abc") assigned to the user and attaches it.(salt = random string)

the string is attached to the password("helloabc") and then coverts it into the hash and that hash is compared with the one with the database and logs him.

//salting rounds(More rounds = more memory)

 data.password = bcrypt.hashSync(data.password, 10);// 10 is recommended.

in this,the hashing runs 10 times and changes it.

the amount can be changed.

//pepper

the attached string is entered to the progam like "!kxy" and added to every password.

the process is like salting but no randomly generated string and it adds to every password not common ones like salting.
